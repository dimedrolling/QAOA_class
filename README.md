# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving various optimization problems. It includes functions to construct Ising Hamiltonians, k-SAT Hamiltonians, and solve the Max Cut problem. The QAOA logic can be used to find approximate solutions to these optimization problems.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you understand the implementation and run the provided examples.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3
- NumPy
- SciPy

### Installing

You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy
```

## Usage
Detailed usage examples can be found in the examples.ipynb file.
### Example 1: Creating an Ising Hamiltonian and Finding Fisher Information Matrix
### Example 2: Creating a k-SAT Hamiltonian and Optimizing it with QAOA
### Example 3: Solving the Max Cut Problem
