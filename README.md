# Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) for solving various optimization problems. It includes functions to construct Ising Hamiltonians, k-SAT Hamiltonians, and solve the Max Cut problem. The QAOA logic can be used to find approximate solutions to these optimization problems.
